This paper is the first application of Lasserre's moment-SOS hierarchy (exploiting sparsity) to verifying robustness of neural networks. Roughly speaking, the verification approaches can be divided into four categories: the SAT/SMT-based approaches represented by [Katz Lab](https://www.katz-lab.com/), the MILP-bsed approaches represented by [VAS Group](https://vas.doc.ic.ac.uk/), the AI-based approaches represented by [SRILAB](https://safeai.ethz.ch/), and the CROWN family represented by [Zico Kolter](https://zicokolter.com/), [Luca Daniel](http://www.mit.edu/~dluca/) and [Cho-Jui Hsieh](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~chohsieh/). All these previous works can be found in [SoK](https://sokcertifiedrobustness.github.io/) which provides full benchmark results and state-of-the-art leaderboard on the certified robustness for deep neural networks.
