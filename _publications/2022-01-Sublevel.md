This paper is about a general polynomial optimization framework exploring sublevel sparsity, that can apply to sparse/dense problems, and has shown good performance compared to state-of-the-art sparse frameworks both in combinatorial optimization and deep learning. Previous work includes [Lasserre, 2001](http://khalilghorbal.info/assets/spa/papers/lasserre.pdf) which is the first paper introducing Lasserre's SDP hierarchy for solving constrained and unconstrained POPs, [Lasserre, 2006](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jean-Bernard-Lasserre/publication/225355464_Convergent_SDP-Relaxations_for_Polynomial_Optimization_with_Sparsity/links/00b4951a3bedcaaae7000000/Convergent-SDP-Relaxations-for-Polynomial-Optimization-with-Sparsity.pdf), [Waki et al., 2005](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=27b11834fa4799674eb4c17e6171ea6eaf68a5dc) which explore correlative sparsity in Lasserre's hierarchy, and [Wang et al., 2019](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.08899.pdf) which explores term sparsity in Lasserre's hierarchy.
